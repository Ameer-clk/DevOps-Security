# Simple Port Scanner

## Overview
This Python script is a simple port scanner that scans for open ports on a specified target host.

## Features
- Scans for open TCP ports on a target host.
- Allows scanning multiple ports simultaneously.
- Prints the status (open/closed) of each scanned port.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script by executing the following command:
    ```
    python simple_port_scanner.py
    ```
3. Provide the IP address or hostname of the target host when prompted.
4. The script will scan the specified ports (22, 443, and 80 by default) and print the status of each port.

## Important Note
- This script is intended for educational purposes and should only be used with permission to scan networks and hosts you own or have explicit authorization to scan.
- Scanning networks or hosts without proper authorization may violate laws and ethical guidelines.

## Customization
- You can customize the `target_ports` variable in the script to specify different ports to scan.
- Modify the `target_host` variable in the script to specify the IP address or hostname of the target host.
